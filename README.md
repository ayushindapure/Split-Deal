# 🚀 SplitDeal – Dockerised Version

This is a Dockerised version of the SplitDeal web application – a simple group expense management tool built using Node.js. This README provides clear instructions on how to build and run the app using Docker.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

SplitDeal helps users track shared expenses and settle them easily. This version has been containerised using Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

---

## 🔧 How to Run This Dockerised App

Follow these steps to build and run the application inside a Docker container:

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Make sure you're in the root of the project folder and run:

docker build --no-cache -t splitdeal-app .

This creates an image named splitdeal-app.

## 2. Run the following command to start the app:

docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env splitdeal-app (📝 Note: If port 3000 is already being used, you can check and stop the process using)

lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>(replace the PID with whatever number which is randomly generated by you terminal)

## 3. Access the App
Once the container is running, go to: http://localhost:3000

## 4. 🧪 Test API Endpoint
To verify the app is working correctly, open your browser or use Postman/cURL to access:

http://localhost:3000/api/student
You should get the following JSON response:

{
  "name": "Ayush Indapure",
  "studentId": "224880003"
}
